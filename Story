Para 1
It was a hot summer’s day. A thirsty crow flew into a village in search of water. The crow flew over the houses, fields, and trees.
But he didn’t find any water. After a long time, he came across a farm. Under one of the trees on the farm was a pitcher of water.

Happy that he found some water finally, 
he swooped down to the tree and then down to the ground. He quickly moved towards the pitcher and looked inside. There was very little
water in the pot. The crow put his beak inside the pitcher but could not reach the water. The water level was too low, and the narrow 
opening prevented his neck from going all the way down.
